# A3Wasteland Tanoa

We are looking for active coders to take over our mission to support community ideas further than what Team Wasteland has on it's current roadmap. TOParma is a new community that thrives off self-sustaining support. 

Notes about our fork:
* We do not use iniDB, iniDB code may not be updated or merged. 
* We use extDB, initially provided by @Torndeco.


We are not a support team. We are a community that enjoys playing arma and saw fit to modify our own A3Wasteland mission file. 

Armajunkies ArmA 3 Wasteland is a harsh survival sandbox mission where 2 teams and independent players fight for survival. Our main objective is to fight over a group of flags, which consist of 1-4 capture points.
