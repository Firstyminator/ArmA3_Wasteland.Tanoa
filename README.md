NoEliteGaming is a community that enjoys playing Arma and saw fit to modify our own A3Wasteland mission file.
 
A3Wasteland is a harsh survival sandbox mission where 2 teams and independent players fight for survival. Our main objective is to fight over a group of flags, which consist of 1-4 capture points.
