# A3Wasteland Tanoa

NoEliteGaming is currently customizing this mission. Feedback is much appreciated!

Notes about my fork:

* I use iniDB, initially provided by A3Wasteland (needed for all Saving - Keep that in mind)
* All kudos to TOPArma and ArmaJunkies for the base of this missionfile! Love your work!
* Credits also go to LoudNL, CRE4MPIE, AgentRev, and all others that do make this possible :)


NoEliteGaming is a community that enjoys playing Arma and saw fit to modify our own A3Wasteland mission file.
 
A3Wasteland is a harsh survival sandbox mission where 2 teams and independent players fight for survival. Our main objective is to fight over a group of flags, which consist of 1-4 capture points.
